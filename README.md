# predic grades to support students
This is one of the applications of machine learning that relies on collecting student data, predicting final grades, identifying faults, and making a decision if a student needs support, and in this way problems can be contained, and the school's reputation can be improved.

We need the prediction of the exam through the first and second test data

multiple linear regression depends on the following linear equation:

I will define the model

In order to apply the prediction to new data, I will extract the weights and the intercept and save them to create a function through which I can enter the test grades and return the expected exam grades to me.

With this, I will create a program to apply the models to a group of students at the same time and classify them according to eligibility for support 
i can applay the modet with new list:

in output, give me new list with the level of each student:

From this classification, many decisions can be taken, such as dividing students into three groups.  And each group will have certain support hours, and a specific level of explanation, according to the eligibility of support for each group.

IN THE END, THE APPLICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS IN EDUCATION WILL GREATLY HELP SCHOOLS TO IMPROVE STUDENTS, AND EXCEL IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION.
